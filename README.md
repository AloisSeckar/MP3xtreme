# MP3xtreme
Simple MP3 player with random graphic window in Delphi

Written in Borland Delphi as semestral paper in "Programming I".

- You can play .mp3 files via this program. 
- You can create "albums" and "collection" in this program and label them with meta-info. 
- You can adjust program skin and player-window background effects.

The repository was just restored from an old backup (2010-07-24) without any pruning or maintaining the code.

I don't plan to work on this program any further...
